# tictactoe

This tic tac toe project is part of the Odin Project's curriculum, specifically the OOP portion.

This project's purpose was to showcase the OOP principles I have learned such as factory functions, module pattern. 

It was mainly written in the module pattern to keep the code organized and only expose the functions and variables we need for the game.

This is a simple tic tac toe game that two people can play.
